# Project Objective: Electric Car Sales Dashboard

## Overview: ##
The objective of this project is to create an interactive dashboard using Power BI that visualizes sales records of electric cars sourced from Kaggle data. The dashboard aims to provide insights into various key performance indicators (KPIs) related to electric vehicle sales, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and understand trends in the market.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):**

1. **Total Vehicles:**
   - Definition: The total number of electric vehicles (BEV and PHEV) sold during the specified period.
   - Importance: Provides an overview of the overall sales volume of electric vehicles.

2. **Average Electric Range:**
   - Definition: The average range (in miles/kilometers) of electric vehicles available for sale.
   - Importance: Indicates the typical distance electric vehicles can travel on a single charge, which is a crucial factor for potential buyers considering electric vehicles.

3. **Total BEV Vehicles and % of Total BEV Vehicles:**
   - Definition: 
     - Total BEV Vehicles: The total number of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) sold.
     - % of Total BEV Vehicles: The percentage of BEVs compared to the total electric vehicle sales.
   - Importance: Helps to understand the market share of BEVs and assess the popularity of pure electric vehicles among consumers.

4. **Total PHEV Vehicles and % of Total PHEV Vehicles:**
   - Definition: 
     - Total PHEV Vehicles: The total number of Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) sold.
     - % of Total PHEV Vehicles: The percentage of PHEVs compared to the total electric vehicle sales.
   - Importance: Provides insights into the market penetration of plug-in hybrid vehicles and their adoption rate compared to other electric vehicle types.
